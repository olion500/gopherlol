# Documentation Assets

This directory contains documentation assets and diagrams.

## âœ… Visual Content Completed

The README now includes a **Mermaid flowchart** that shows how gopherlol works - this is much better than screenshots because:
- âœ… Always renders correctly on GitHub
- âœ… Works in both light and dark themes  
- âœ… Version controlled as text
- âœ… Easy to update and maintain
- âœ… Professional and clear

## ðŸ“Š Current Diagrams

### Main Flow Diagram
The Mermaid flowchart in the README shows:
1. User typing command in address bar
2. Server processing the request  
3. Command lookup (known vs unknown)
4. Appropriate redirect (GitHub vs Google fallback)

## ðŸŽ¨ Future Visual Ideas

If we want to add more visual content later:

### ðŸ“¸ Optional Screenshots:
1. **Browser setup**: Chrome's search engine settings page
2. **Help page**: The rich HTML help page showing all commands

### ðŸŽ¯ Design Guidelines:
- Keep it simple and focused
- Use Mermaid diagrams over screenshots when possible
- Ensure content works in both GitHub light/dark themes
